# Treap
Using Python to implement Treap structure

## How to run:
```
python3 test_treaps.py 
```
"test_treaps.py" is the file for testing my treap if it is implementing well or not.

## Introduction:
A treap is a binary search tree that uses randomization to produce balanced trees. In addition to holding a key-value
pair (a map entry), each node of a treap holds a randomly chosen priority value, such that the priority values satisfy the
heap property.
